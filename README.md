# CryptoData Analysis Tool
## Sentiment Analysis and Data Visualization for Cryptocurrency Brands
CryptoData Analysis Tool is a Python-based project that processes and analyzes cryptocurrency brand sentiment data using web-scraped reviews. This project follows a structured pipeline that involves data cleaning, handling missing values, transformation, statistical analysis, visualization, and exporting results.

Features and Functionalities
### 1. Data Cleaning & Structuring
The scraped data is processed and stored in a structured format.
A class CryptoData is implemented to encapsulate brand-related data.
The class includes methods for:
Removing unnecessary characters.
Standardizing text formats.
Organizing sentiment scores and review data.
### 2. Handling Missing Values
Missing or incomplete sentiment scores and reviews are handled using default values.
Empty fields are replaced with NaN values or meaningful placeholders.
Ensures data consistency before performing analysis.
### 3. Data Transformation
Sentiment scores are transformed to a standardized scale.
Time-series rolling averages are computed using NumPy to smooth out fluctuations.
Data normalization is performed where required.
### 4. Analysis of Data
Several key statistical analyses are performed:

Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation: Helps understand the average sentiment trends and variation.
Sentiment Correlation: Identifies relationships between sentiment trends of different brands.
Identifying Most Positive & Negative Posts: Extracts extreme sentiment reviews.
### 5. Calculating Rolling Averages
Rolling averages are calculated using NumPy to observe sentiment trends over time.
Helps to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
### 6. Data Visualization
Uses Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting sentiment trends and comparisons.
Line Chart: Displays sentiment trends over time.
Bar Chart: Compares sentiment scores across brands.
Pie Chart: Shows sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
Correlation Heatmap: Displays relationships between different brand sentiments.
### 7. Exporting Data to CSV
The final cleaned and analyzed data is saved in a CSV file for future reference.
Ensures reproducibility of results and easy integration with other tools.
